# About

I am Thom Veldpaus, with a little more than 3 years of experience, primarily working with PHP to build plugins for an e-commerce platform. I decided to take a different journey and got into JavaScript and mainly React.

## Personal Learning Path and Motivation

Since June this year, (2023) I began exploring React.js out of curiosity, sparked by an article I came across on the internet. It didn't take long before I delved into the documentation. What caught my attention was the comprehensive documentation and explanations for everything you can do with React.js, a significant difference from what I was accustomed to working with this e-commerce platform.

It has been a couple of months since I started this journey, and it hasn't ended. I've tried many different approaches to build a React.js application, and I am still learning new things every day. My learning journey wasn't really perfect at all, I was a little bit overwelmed by all the kind if possebilities you have working met React and JavaScript, that I spend too much time on finding out what all kind of tooling there is for setting up an application and began getting into Next.js because they had a lot "extra" to offer than just basic React.

After a while I began to notice that having a lot of extra support from tools and packages and functionalities from a framework were not always liberating but also began to feel restricting because it gave me often the feeling to want to hack into the framework to get things done the way I wanted it to be done. Luckily I stumbled onto a youtube tutorial that showed me that working strictly with React it is possible to create a functional website with routing, pages and all the freedom to do whatever I could think of, without the need of reading into how to do things a certain way because the framework wants it to be done that way, for good reasons. Next.js was an awesome experience to get to learn how to work with it basically, but I felt that I missed out on all the time I could have spend on learning how to customize an application perfectly to my own needs and wishes.

That's the stage I'm now at, trying to construct a application that will do anything I can think of. I have an issues page on the bottom of the left navigation menu, it's the list of Jira issues I created for myself to keep track of what I want to do and what I have done. I have taken very little effort to phrase my sentences well because noting down an idea usually occurs when I am busy working on something else that has to wait because I might otherwise forget about or get distracted from it, but I think it's still worth the effort because it starts to become like a library of cool stuff I deemed possible to be very cool, like a collection of future material, if something is very cool, interesting or useful, I might write about it on this website.

Since I read an article about the MERN stack, I felt like this is everything I need to be able to eventually reach any goal I'd set for myself and decided to start a big project this time. A huge idea, not even possible to maintain this application by myself if it would get the traffic with handling enourmous amounts of data together with lots of functionalities that have to stay compatible also after updates. So why would I start a project like that?

### Disclaimers

I understand that I am not a senior developer yet, but I might inspire someone to adopt something that works for me and that makes me happy. Also, by writing down my thoughts and ideas, explaining how I approach things, I can learn from myself because I want it to be very clear and correct.

This is just a very simple website I am using to share my progress and to keep track of my development process, but I will try to make it fun for everybody by implementing some interactive elements in the process.

> It is possible that I write something that is not entirely correct, or that I use the wrong terminology, or maybe sometimes I would explain something in a way that it seems that I mean something entirely opposite; it happens. I'm not perfect; technically, I am still a junior in JavaScript development, but I am a fast learner and have experience to see effectiveness in tools or ways to work that boost productivity without losing quality, mainly by increasing maintainability and being as understandable as possible.

#### Conclusion

The reason I make the decision to start working on an application with a goal far and fat away is, because this is what I want to do. I like customizing, building something from the ground up the way I have tought of. Of course I change my mind a lot because I am really still in the learning fasa and in the future I will be able to weigh the pro's and con's of desicions even better, but I am on a pretty stable place with everything the MERN stack has to offer.

#### Final Thoughts

You made it this far, thank you for your interest. I hope this website is of enjoyment to you and that you will find something useful here!
