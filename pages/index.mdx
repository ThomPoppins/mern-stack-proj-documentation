## Introduction

Welcome to the information page where I share details about the development of my **MERN** stack application. I am Thom Veldpaus, with a little more than 3 years of experience, primarily working with PHP to build plugins for an e-commerce platform.

### Personal Learning Path and Motivation

On the 27th of June this year, I began exploring React.js out of curiosity, sparked by an article I came across on the internet. It didn't take long before I delved into the documentation. What caught my attention was the comprehensive documentation and explanations for everything you can do with React.js, a significant difference from what I was accustomed to working with this e-commerce platform.

It has been a couple of months since I started this journey, and it still hasn't ended. I've tried many different approaches to build a React.js application, and I am still learning new things every day. I am confident that I can build a full-stack application with the MERN stack, and I am quite convinced that none of my ideas are impossible, as long as I am willing to put in the time and effort to learn and understand. This is the way to possibilities far beyond what is imaginable even now.

#### The Business Plan

The exact business plan I have in mind for this application will remain confidential. However, by exploring the [Interactive Demo](/interactive-demo) section, you can gain a general idea of the scale and focus of this project.

I hope my idea will eventually gain momentum and materialize. I dare to dream about it and pursue a goal that may be distant, but the guarantee of personal growth in the process makes it worthwhile to work on it either way.

#### Disclaimers

I understand that I am not a senior developer yet, but I might inspire someone to adopt something that works for me and that makes me happy. Also, by writing down my thoughts and ideas, explaining how I approach things, I can learn from myself because I want it to be very clear and correct.

This is just a very simple website I am using to share my progress and to keep track of my development process, but I will try to make it fun for everybody by implementing some interactive elements in the process.

> **Disclaimer**: It is possible that I write something that is not entirely correct, or that I use the wrong terminology, or maybe sometimes I would explain something in a way that it seems that I mean something entirely opposite; it happens. I'm not perfect; technically, I am still a junior in JavaScript development, but I am a fast learner and have experience to see effectiveness in tools or ways to work that boost productivity without losing quality, mainly by increasing maintainability and being as understandable as possible.

#### Final Note about Me

I hope you find it interesting. This was the final part where I talked about myself. Now, let's dive into the details of the application I'm creating, the tools I'm using, and why I've made certain decisions.

### Application Name

It's clearly a MERN stack project, but writing it down like MERN_STACK_PROJ. was more an act of being tired of the standard repository name conventions... That's all.

I'm not in a hurry to change it at all, though. I got used to it; it grew on me. After all, it describes what this project is and always will be and maybe in many different kinds of ways. Forking it and creating somewhat or very similar applications for a certain target audience based on this fundamental one, who knows...

### Technical Description:

A full-stack **JavaScript** application (in early development), built upon the **MERN** stack primarily with **React.js** (utilizing **Redux** for state management) on the client side, and an **ExpressJS** backend server providing API endpoints on Node.js for data management between the client and a **MongoDB** database, using the NPM **Mongoose** package, a popular **Object Data Modeling** (**ODM**) library.

> I also make use of various packages, but only if they are complementary and necessary. I believe in a "less is more" approach to external packages in my application, aiming for stability and independence from external sources and updates.

**Next, it's time to get it running on your local machine!**

If you do not want to set up the application on your local machine, you can always skip through to the [Interactive Demo](/interactive-demo) section to see what the application looks like, but the information will probably not be completely up to date.
