## Introduction

Welcome to the informational website where I share details about the development of my **MERN** stack application.

![Homepage Search Engine](https://github.com/ThomPoppins/MERN_STACK_PROJ./blob/main/screenshots/001.png?raw=true)

### Technical Description:

A full-stack **JavaScript** application (in early development), built upon the **MERN** stack primarily with **React.js** (utilizing **Redux** for state management) on the client side, and an **ExpressJS** backend server providing API endpoints on Node.js for data management between the client and a **MongoDB** database, using the NPM **Mongoose** package, a popular **Object Data Modeling** (**ODM**) library.

> I also make use of various packages, but only if they are complementary and necessary. I believe in a "less is more" approach to external packages in my application, aiming for stability and independence from external sources and updates.

**Next, it's time to get it running on your local machine!**

If you do not want to set up the application on your local machine, you can always skip through to the [Interactive Demo](/interactive-demo) section to see what the application looks like, but the information will probably not be completely up to date.

#### Business Plan

The exact business plan I have in mind for this application will remain a secret for now. However, by exploring the [Interactive Demo](/interactive-demo) section, you can gain a general idea of the scale and focus of this project.

I hope my idea will eventually gain momentum and materialize. I dare to dream about it and pursue a goal that may be distant, but the guarantee of personal growth in the process makes it worthwhile to work on it either way.
