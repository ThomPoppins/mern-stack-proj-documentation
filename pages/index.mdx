# MERN_STACK_PROJ.

## Introduction

### Description:

A full stack JavaScript** application in early development, building upon the **MERN** stack mainly with **React.js** (+ **Redux** state management) on the client side and **ExpressJS** backend server providing API end points on Node.js for data management between the client and **MongoDB** database with the NPM **Mongoose** package which is a popular **Object Data Modeling** (**ODM**) library.

Also I make use of a lot of different packages but only if they are complementary and necessary, I feel like less is more using external packages in my application because I plan on making the application as stable and independent possible from external packages and sources (with updates).

> **Note:** The exact business plan I have in mind for this application will remain secret, but if you read trough the [Visual Demo](#visual-demo) section then you will have a general idea about the size of this project where this application is all about. I hope my idea will eventually start to snowball and turn in to something real, I dare to dream about that and to pursue a goal still far away, but it's a guarantee that I will grow in the process and that makes it worth to work on it either way.
