# Interactive Demo

## Intro

Get a general impression of my application and interact with some examples. I hope you enjoy it!

> **Note:** This demo is interesting, but incomplete and not final. Also it is impossible to keep this demo completely up to date with the development progress. The main purpose is to give a general impression of the application. For complete understanding of the technical workings of each component of the application you're free to look into the source code and for any remaining questions you can ask me anything in a mail to [thompoppins@gmail.com](mailto:thompoppins@gmail.com).

### Sections

In this interactive demo I seperated different aspects of the application in different sections. Here's a short summary of those sections.

#### Users

Here you can find everything all users of the application can do and see.

#### Companies

Here you can find everything related to the companies that registered to the application.
