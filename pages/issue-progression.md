# Jira Issues

- [ ] [MERNSTACK-57] Create Owner model. Owner schema should set up a one-to-one relationship with the User schema by using a `userId` field in the Owner schema that references the `_id` field of the User schema. This will allow to associate each Owner document with a single User document.
- [ ] [MERNSTACK-62] Create `junction` table between `Company` and `Project`. This table will be used because of the many-to-many relationship and additional properties that are needed to link a company to a project. (see backend devdocs folder)
- [ ] [MERNSTACK-63] Create `junction` table between `User` and `Company`. (also a many-to-many relationship, user would be customer of companies and companies would have move then one customers) CONSIDER: Saving users as customers to `company` model instead of creating a `junction` table. This will allow to associate each Company document with multiple User documents. No need for a `junction` table that will make it more complex without any use for it.
- [x] [MERNSTACK-142] Update README.md with explanation about the validators I created in the frontend application. Explain the regex of every validator used to validate and the test method that returns true or false.
- [x] [MERNSTACK-14] Create a new schema and model for user.

- [x] [MERNSTACK-59] Create one-to-many relationship between Owner and Company in the Owner schema. This will allow to associate each Owner document with multiple Company documents. UPDATE: This is not needed because the Company schema will have an `owners` field that will be an array of owner objects with `userId` field.
- [x] [MERNSTACK-60] Create `user` authentication and authorization functionality using JSON Web Token authorization. (see backend devdocs folder)
- [x] [MERNSTACK-61] Create `junction` table for many-to-many relationship between `owners` and `companies`. (see backend devdocs folder) CANCELLED: For now it is easier to just add an `owner` field to the `Company` schema and model. This will allow to associate each Company document with company owners. No need for a `junction` table that will make it more complex without any use for it.

- [x] [MERNSTACK-292] Correct the README.md file everywhere I talk about Base64 strings and Blob images. My understanding was wrong and that's why it needs to be corrected to actual information. Base64 is a binary-to-text encoding scheme. Blob stands for Binary Large Object and is used for storing binary data, my understanding was that those two were the same thing, but they are not, Blob is raw binary data and Base64 is a representation of binary data in an ASCII string format.
